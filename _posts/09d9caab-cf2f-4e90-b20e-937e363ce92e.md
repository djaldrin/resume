I found a great coffee spot in Boracay, tucked away on the other side of the main beach—less crowd, more chill. I ordered a Spanish latte for ₱180, and it was really good. I ended up spending three hours at Kalma Cafe, just chilling and staring blankly while sipping my coffee. I’d really love to find a place like this near Manila.

The owner of the cafe also runs a kite surfing school. There were a lot of people out on the water, kite surfing—it looked so fun. I’ve tried it before, but it’s definitely for people who are fit. I need to work on that first, then I’ll give it another shot next time.
