  Finally tried Jjajangmyeon in Korea after years of drooling over it in

Growing up, I always watched K-dramas, and the one thing that always made me drool was when the characters were eating Jjajangmyeon. I thought it would be very salty and savory, just like yakisoba.

Last December, my family and I went to South Korea for the first time, and I was really excited to finally try Jjajangmyeon! But behold—it was not what I was expecting. I didn’t like the taste of it. Still, I won’t give up yet—I’ll definitely try it again next time I’m in Korea! Just like kimchi, I didn’t like it at first, but it eventually became an acquired taste.
